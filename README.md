## Usage
To run locally cd into your directory and install dependencies first:
```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

Once they are installed run the gulp process which will automatically launch it in chrome.

```
gulp
```

The jquery.panzoom.min.js file is used as a dependancy for the Maps page, and should be placed outside of the `src/` folder in the root of the project directory.
